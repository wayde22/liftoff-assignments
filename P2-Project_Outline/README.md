### Overview
My wife sells investments and insurance so her work life revolves around helping people earn money over the long term 
and helping people protect what they currently own. In the event that your car is totaled, you carry insurance to cover the 
car so you can go home, the place that you feel comfortable and wait for your car to be repaired or replaced. While that can 
can be a set back for you and a bit of a hassle by having to catch rides until your car is fixed or whatever the scenario 
you always have home in that event. But what happens if your the one place that you feel comfortable, filled
with all the treasures that you have bought with the money that you have earned over the years catches on fire or blown 
away.  

Well, that would be devastating and how are you going to get back what you have. Many people have insurance to cover it
but how do your recall everything that you had so that you can turn it into your insurance company. They give a
household inventory sheet or booklets but how are you going to fit all the stuff that you have in that little booklet 
or on paper. Even if you could, you are distressed from your house and all of it contents burning down so now you have 
to remember everything that you own that was inside. The web app will keep track off that for you from room to room, to 
house to garage. It will list the items, a description, the model numbers, purchase date, cost, current value, pictures and
receipts. A minimal amount of work now could recoup all of your belonging later.
